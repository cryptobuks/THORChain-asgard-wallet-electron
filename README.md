# Asgard Wallet POC

This repo for development purposes only. Serving as a short term development 'sandbox' for testing and development of UI/API components and features only asynchronously from the mian production framework repository. To be incorporated into production codebase at a future date, deprecating this repository.

### Framework

This is initial implementation of the Asgard Wallet/Asgardex UI into the `electron-react-boilerplate` framework: [github link](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate)

### Original Wallet Repository

This wallet software was originally developed for test builds and deployments, and is a migration of the front-end UI code from the original [Asgard Wallet repository](https://gitlab.com/thorchain/asgard-wallet)
